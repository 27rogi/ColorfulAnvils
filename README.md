# Colorful Anvils
### ðŸŽ¨ Use large variety of colors in anvils

</div>

### Usage
This mod uses [PlaceholderAPI](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/text-format/) by @Patbox which allows you to format text with support for **RGB** colors, **gradients**, and many more! Simply rename item using tags.

### Permissions
Starting from mod version 1.0.2 you are able to use permissions to control player ability to use formatting. By default `colorfulanvils.use` permission is set to `true` for all players. You can disable it via any permissions manager mod to prevent text formatting.

### Known problems
**No problems are known at this moment**, but be aware because this mod uses mixins to modify original Minecraft anvil code and this may cause issues with mods that do the same thing!
